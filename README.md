## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the Data such as

1. Retrieve the total sales for each category.
2. Find the number of sales transactions in each region.

## DATA ANALYSIS
```SQL
1. SELECT * FROM [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]

2. ---- NO 1. To retrieve the total sales for each category

SELECT product, sum([Total_Sales]) AS Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM([Total_Sales]) DESC;

3. -----  No 2. find the number of sales transactions in each region

SELECT Region , COUNT([Quantity]) AS Count_Sales
FROM  [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY COUNT([Quantity])

4. ----  NO 3. fInd the highest selling product by total sales value

SELECT TOP 1 PRODUCT, SUM(quantity*[UnitPrice]) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
GROUP BY product

5. ---- NO 4. Calculate total revenue per product
 
 SELECT Product, SUM([Total_Sales]) AS Revenue
 FROM  [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
 GROUP BY  product
 ORDER BY Sum([Total_Sales]) ASC;

6.  ---NO 5. calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.

     Select month(OrderDate) as month,
  sum(quantity*unitprice) as MonthlySales
From [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
Where year(OrderDate) = year(GetDate())
Group by month(OrderDate)
Order by Month;

7. --- NO 6. Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.

SELECT TOP 5 [Customer_Id], SUM([Total_Sales]) AS total_purchase_amount
FROM [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
GROUP BY [Customer_Id]
ORDER BY SUM([Total_Sales]) DESC;

8. SELECT 
    Region, 
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Regional_Sales,
    (SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) * 1.0 / (SELECT SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) 
	FROM [dbo].[RD SALES DATA])) * 100 AS Percentage_of_Total_Sales
FROM 
    [dbo].[RD SALES DATA]
GROUP BY 
    Region
ORDER BY 
    Regional_Sales DESC;

GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(CASE

```
